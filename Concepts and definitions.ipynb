    "Large language models are trained on a large set of data from various sources. Large language models have neural network architectures with milllions of parameters. These parameters are capable to capture patterns and nuances of languages. Also, large language models use another technique called Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). LLMs do not have subjective experience, emotions, or conciousness as human. LLMs works completely based on data that those are trained on."
